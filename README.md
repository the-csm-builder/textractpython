This code is a Python script that utilizes the boto3 library to extract text from an image file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, and then stores the extracted text in an Amazon DynamoDB table.
Dependencies

    boto3
    json

Functionality

    The script is triggered by an S3 event, and the event object is passed to the lambda_handler function as the first argument.
    It extracts the bucket name and object key from the event object, and uses these to set up clients for Amazon Textract, S3, and DynamoDB.
    It then uses the Textract client to extract text from the image file, and stores the extracted text in a variable.
    Next, it creates or accesses a DynamoDB table and insert the extracted text into it, with the file name as the primary key.
    Finally, it copies the image file to another location in the S3 bucket for tracking progress.

Configuration

    Replace 'TABLE_NAME' in line 29 with the name of your DynamoDB table.
    Replace 'BUCKET' in line 38 with the name of the destination S3 bucket where you want to copy the image file.
    Replace 'DESTINATION_KEY/' in line 38 with the key prefix of the destination S3 bucket.
    Make sure that you have the correct AWS credentials set up on your local machine or in the environment where the script is being run.

Usage

    To test the script, you can simulate an S3 event by passing a sample event object to the lambda_handler function.
    To use the script in an AWS Lambda function, you will need to package the script and its dependencies, and then upload the package to the Lambda function.
